# Website

This website is a clone of Brian Ruiz's personal portfolio website. All credit goes to Brian Ruiz for the design, features, and implementation.

The original website was designed to be simplistic and clean while including features like MDX blog posts with view counts, a dark mode toggle, an about page, and more. I am grateful for their work and the permission to use it.
