This project was a personal experiment, I wanted to see if I could create a lightweight, interactive **Spotify widget** that reflects the music a user is currently listening to.

The inspiration came from **Discord's "listening to Spotify" status**, which I always found really cool. So I decided to try building something similar, just for fun.

The result is a minimal yet dynamic music card interface that connects to your Spotify account, displays current playback, and uses **React** and **Framer Motion** for clean, responsive animations.

Built in June 2024, the app features:

- **Spotify Web API integration** – Authenticates with your account and displays current track info in real time.
- **Framer Motion animations** – Smooth 3D tilt effects on hover, inspired by interactive UI elements.
- **Fully responsive design** – Works across devices, but optimized for larger screens due to layout constraints.
- **Modern stack** – Built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and deployed to Vercel.

This was mostly a curiosity project, a way for me to explore OAuth, creative UI, and the Spotify API all in one place.

## Technologies used

- React & Vite
- Spotify Web API
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (for deployment)
