This project is a custom-built **Spotify web application**, developed using **React** and powered by the **Spotify Web API**. The goal was to create a smooth and responsive user experience for discovering and playing music while experimenting with advanced UI techniques.

Built during June 2024, the app includes:

- **Real-time Spotify integration** – Search for songs, view track metadata, and control playback.
- **State management and authentication** – Token handling with Spotify’s OAuth flow, managing refresh logic, and securely accessing user data.
- **3D tilt effects** – Interactive tilt animations on album cards using `framer-motion`, designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Mobile-first responsive design** – Carefully debugged and optimized for mobile tilt responsiveness and touch interaction.

This was also a deep dive into managing cross-device behaviors, like tilt effects on different screen sizes, and lifting state in React to ensure clean, centralized logic between components like the player, search bar, and track list.
