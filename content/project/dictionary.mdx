### About the Project

This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge for building a dictionary web app. The app allows users to search for words, view definitions from the Free Dictionary API, play audio files for pronunciations, and switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts. Additionally, users can toggle between light and dark themes based on their system preferences.
